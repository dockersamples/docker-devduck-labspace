# Basic Multi-Agent Interaction

Now that your system is properly deployed and configured, it's time to explore how the multi-agent system works in practice. You'll learn to interact with DevDuck and understand how it coordinates between different agents to provide intelligent responses.

!!! info "Learning Objectives"
    - Master the DevDuck web interface
    - Understand agent routing and decision-making
    - Practice basic multi-agent conversations
    - Monitor agent communication patterns

## Understanding the Interface

### üåê Web Interface Overview

Let's start by familiarizing yourself with the DevDuck interface:

1. **Open the Interface**: Navigate to [http://localhost:8000/dev-ui/?app=devduck](http://localhost:8000/dev-ui/?app=devduck)

2. **Interface Components**:
   - **Chat Area**: Main conversation interface
   - **Input Field**: Where you type your messages
   - **Agent Indicator**: Shows which agents are active
   - **System Status**: Connection and health indicators

### üîç Interface Features

Explore these key features:

#### Message Types
The interface supports various message formats:
- **Text Messages**: Standard conversation
- **Code Blocks**: Formatted code snippets
- **System Messages**: Agent status updates
- **Error Messages**: Troubleshooting information

#### Agent Status Indicators
Look for these visual cues:
- üü¢ **Green**: Agent is online and responding
- üü° **Yellow**: Agent is processing
- üî¥ **Red**: Agent is unavailable or erroring
- üîµ **Blue**: Agent is initializing

## First Interactions

### ü§ñ Basic Conversation

Let's start with simple interactions to test the system:

#### Exercise 1: Introduction

**Try this conversation:**

```
You: Hello DevDuck! Can you introduce yourself?
```

**Expected Response Pattern:**
- DevDuck will introduce itself as a multi-agent system
- It should mention its capabilities and available agents
- The response might route to the Local Agent for a quick reply

**Monitor the logs** while you do this:
```bash
# In a separate terminal, watch the logs
docker compose logs -f devduck-agent
```

#### Exercise 2: Agent Awareness

**Ask about the agents:**

```
You: What agents are available in this system?
```

**Expected Response:**
DevDuck should explain:
- Local Agent for quick processing
- Cerebras Agent for complex analysis
- Its own role as orchestrator
- How it decides which agent to use

### üß† Understanding Agent Routing

DevDuck makes intelligent decisions about which agent should handle each request. Let's explore this:

#### Exercise 3: Simple vs Complex Queries

**Simple Query (likely routed to Local Agent):**
```
You: What is Python?
```

**Complex Query (likely routed to Cerebras Agent):**
```
You: Can you analyze this algorithm and suggest optimizations?

def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)
```

**Observation Points:**
- Notice response time differences
- Check which agent handles each request in the logs
- Compare the depth and quality of responses

### üìä Monitoring Agent Communication

Let's understand how agents communicate internally:

#### Real-time Monitoring Setup

```bash
# Terminal 1: Agent logs
docker compose logs -f devduck-agent

# Terminal 2: Resource monitoring  
watch docker stats

# Terminal 3: Network monitoring
docker compose exec devduck-agent netstat -tuln
```

#### Exercise 4: Multi-step Request

**Send a request that requires multiple agents:**

```
You: I'm building a Node.js application. Can you first explain what Express.js is, and then show me a complete example with error handling?
```

**What to observe:**
1. **Initial Processing**: DevDuck analyzes the request
2. **Agent Routing**: Request may be split between agents
3. **Response Assembly**: Final response combines multiple agent outputs
4. **Resource Usage**: CPU and memory spikes during processing

## Advanced Interaction Patterns

### üéØ Context Awareness

Test how well the system maintains conversation context:

#### Exercise 5: Conversational Context

**Multi-turn conversation:**

```
Turn 1: "I'm working on a web application with authentication"
Turn 2: "What security best practices should I follow?"
Turn 3: "Can you show me how to implement JWT tokens?"
Turn 4: "What about refresh tokens?"
```

**Observation Points:**
- Does DevDuck remember previous context?
- How does it maintain conversation flow?
- Which agents contribute to different parts?

### üîÑ Agent Fallback Mechanisms

Test what happens when agents are unavailable:

#### Exercise 6: Resilience Testing

**Simulate agent failure:**

```bash
# Temporarily block Cerebras API (simulate network issues)
# Add this to your hosts file temporarily:
echo "127.0.0.1 api.cerebras.ai" >> /etc/hosts
```

**Then try a complex query:**
```
You: Analyze this complex algorithm and provide architectural recommendations for a microservices system.
```

**Observe:**
- How does DevDuck handle the failure?
- Does it fall back to Local Agent?
- What error handling is displayed?

**Clean up:**
```bash
# Remove the hosts entry
sudo sed -i '/api.cerebras.ai/d' /etc/hosts
```

## Practical Use Cases

### üíª Development Assistance

Let's explore real-world development scenarios:

#### Exercise 7: Code Review

**Submit code for review:**

```
You: Can you review this JavaScript function for bugs and improvements?

function processUserData(users) {
  const results = [];
  for (let i = 0; i < users.length; i++) {
    if (users[i].age > 18) {
      results.push({
        name: users[i].name,
        email: users[i].email.toLowerCase(),
        age: users[i].age
      });
    }
  }
  return results;
}
```

**Expected Agent Behavior:**
- DevDuck might route to Cerebras for detailed analysis
- Local Agent might handle syntax validation
- Combined response with suggestions and improvements

#### Exercise 8: Architecture Discussion

**Ask for architectural guidance:**

```
You: I'm building a real-time chat application that needs to handle 10,000 concurrent users. What architecture would you recommend?
```

**This should trigger:**
- Complex routing to Cerebras Agent
- Detailed architectural analysis
- Multiple considerations and recommendations

### üß™ Debugging and Troubleshooting

#### Exercise 9: Error Analysis

**Present an error for analysis:**

```
You: I'm getting this error in my Node.js app:

TypeError: Cannot read property 'map' of undefined
    at processItems (/app/utils.js:15:23)
    at UserController.getUsers (/app/controllers/user.js:42:18)

Can you help me debug this?
```

**Agent Response Analysis:**
- How quickly does DevDuck identify the issue?
- Which agent provides the solution?
- Does it offer multiple debugging approaches?

## Performance Analysis

### üìà Response Time Patterns

Let's analyze response patterns systematically:

#### Create a Test Script

```python
# Create response_time_test.py
import requests
import time
import json

def test_response_times():
    """Test response times for different query types."""
    
    test_cases = [
        {"query": "Hello", "type": "simple", "expected_agent": "local"},
        {"query": "What is JavaScript?", "type": "medium", "expected_agent": "local"},
        {"query": "Design a scalable microservices architecture", "type": "complex", "expected_agent": "cerebras"},
        {"query": "Analyze this algorithm for time complexity", "type": "complex", "expected_agent": "cerebras"}
    ]
    
    results = []
    
    for case in test_cases:
        print(f"Testing: {case['type']} query")
        
        start_time = time.time()
        
        response = requests.post(
            'http://localhost:8000/chat',
            json={
                "message": case['query'],
                "conversation_id": f"test-{int(time.time())}"
            }
        )
        
        duration = time.time() - start_time
        
        results.append({
            "query_type": case['type'],
            "duration": duration,
            "status": response.status_code
        })
        
        print(f"  Duration: {duration:.2f}s")
        time.sleep(1)  # Brief pause between requests
    
    # Summary
    print("\nüìä Response Time Summary:")
    for result in results:
        print(f"  {result['query_type']:8}: {result['duration']:6.2f}s")

if __name__ == '__main__':
    test_response_times()
```

**Run the test:**
```bash
python response_time_test.py
```

### üîç Log Analysis

**Create a log analysis script:**

```bash
# Create log_analyzer.sh
cat > log_analyzer.sh << 'EOF'
#!/bin/bash

echo "üîç DevDuck Log Analysis"
echo "====================="

# Get recent logs
LOGS=$(docker compose logs devduck-agent --tail=100)

# Count agent routing decisions
echo "Agent Routing Summary:"
echo "$LOGS" | grep -i "routing to" | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr

# Response time analysis
echo -e "\nResponse Time Patterns:"
echo "$LOGS" | grep -i "response_time" | tail -10

# Error analysis
echo -e "\nRecent Errors:"
echo "$LOGS" | grep -i "error\|exception\|failed" | tail -5

# Health check status
echo -e "\nHealth Check Status:"
echo "$LOGS" | grep -i "health" | tail -3

EOF

chmod +x log_analyzer.sh
./log_analyzer.sh
```
