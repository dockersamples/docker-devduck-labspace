# Prerequisites & System Overview

Before diving into the hands-on exercises, let's ensure your environment is properly set up and understand the system architecture we'll be working with.

## System Requirements

### Hardware Requirements

| Component | Minimum | Recommended |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| **RAM** | 8 GB | 16 GB+ |
| **Storage** | 10 GB free | 20 GB+ free |
| **CPU** | 4 cores | 8+ cores |
| **Network** | Stable internet | High-speed broadband |

!!! warning "Resource Usage"
    AI models can be memory-intensive. The local agent will download and cache models, which requires significant disk space and RAM.

### Software Prerequisites

#### ✅ Required Software

1. **Docker Desktop** (Latest version)
   - Windows: Docker Desktop for Windows
   - macOS: Docker Desktop for Mac  
   - Linux: Docker Engine + Docker Compose

2. **Git** (for cloning repositories)

3. **Text Editor/IDE** (VS Code, PyCharm, or similar)

4. **Web Browser** (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)

#### 🔧 Verification Commands

Run these commands to verify your setup:

```bash
# Check Docker version
docker --version

# Check Docker Compose version
docker compose version

# Verify Docker is running
docker ps

# Check available system resources
docker system info
```

**Expected Output Example:**
```
Docker version 24.0.0, build 1234567
Docker Compose version v2.20.0
```

### API Requirements

#### Cerebras API Setup

1. **Create Account**: Visit [https://cloud.cerebras.ai/](https://cloud.cerebras.ai/)
2. **Get API Key**: Navigate to API section and generate a key
3. **Verify Access**: Test API connectivity (we'll do this together)

!!! tip "Free Tier Available"
    Cerebras offers a generous free tier for testing and learning. You won't need to provide payment information for this workshop.

## System Architecture Overview

Let's explore the multi-agent system architecture you'll be building:

```

### Component Breakdown

#### 🎼 **DevDuck Orchestrator**

  - Handle simple queries and code completion
  - Provide quick responses for development tasks
  - Cache frequently used information
  - Fallback processing when cloud services are unavailable
- **Technology**: Python with local ML models
- **Models**: Lightweight language models (1-7B parameters)

#### 🧠 **Cerebras Agent**

- **Responsibilities**:
  - Extend agent capabilities with tools and plugins
  - Handle file system operations
  - Provide additional context and memory
  - Enable advanced agent interactions
- **Technology**: Docker's MCP Gateway service

### Communication Flow

#### 📡 **Request Processing Flow**

1. **User Input**: User sends request via web interface
2. **Orchestration**: DevDuck analyzes request and determines routing
3. **Agent Selection**: Based on complexity and requirements:
   - Simple queries → Local Agent
   - Complex analysis → Cerebras Agent  
   - Multi-step tasks → Both agents in sequence
4. **Processing**: Selected agent(s) process the request
5. **Response**: DevDuck aggregates and returns unified response

#### 🔄 **Inter-Agent Communication**

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant U as User
    participant DO as DevDuck Orchestrator
    participant LA as Local Agent
    participant CA as Cerebras Agent
    
    U->>DO: "Explain this complex algorithm"
    DO->>DO: Analyze request complexity
    DO->>CA: Route to Cerebras Agent
    CA->>CA: Process with advanced AI
    CA->>DO: Return detailed explanation
    DO->>LA: "Generate code example"
    LA->>LA: Create simple example
    LA->>DO: Return code snippet
    DO->>U: Combined response with explanation + code
```

### Container Architecture

Each component runs in its own Docker container for isolation and scalability:

#### 📦 **Container Specifications**

| Service | Image | CPU | Memory | Ports |
|---------|-------|-----|---------|-------|
| DevDuck Orchestrator | Custom Python | 0.5-1.0 | 1-2 GB | 8000 |

    subgraph "Docker Network: devduck-network"
        subgraph "External Access"
            P[Port 8000<br/>Host → Container]
        end
        
        subgraph "Internal Services"

```

## Environment Configuration

### Required Environment Variables

You'll need to configure these environment variables:

```bash
# Cerebras Configuration
CEREBRAS_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
CEREBRAS_BASE_URL=https://api.cerebras.ai/v1
CEREBRAS_CHAT_MODEL=llama3.1-70b

# Local Agent Configuration  
LOCAL_MODEL_NAME=microsoft/DialoGPT-medium
LOCAL_MODEL_CACHE=/tmp/models

# System Configuration
LOG_LEVEL=INFO
DEBUG_MODE=false
```

### Docker Compose Structure

The system uses Docker Compose for orchestration:

```yaml
version: '3.8'
services:
  devduck-agent:
    build: ./agents
    ports:
      - "8000:8000"
    environment:
      - CEREBRAS_API_KEY=${CEREBRAS_API_KEY}
    depends_on:
      - mcp-gateway
      
  mcp-gateway:
    image: docker/mcp-gateway:latest
    command: /docker-mcp gateway serve mcp-gateway-catalog.yaml
```

## Pre-flight Checklist

## Troubleshooting Common Setup Issues

### Docker Issues
- **Problem**: "Docker daemon not running"
- **Solution**: Start Docker Desktop and wait for it to fully initialize

### Memory Issues  
- **Problem**: System running slow or containers crashing
- **Solution**: Increase Docker Desktop memory allocation to 8GB+
